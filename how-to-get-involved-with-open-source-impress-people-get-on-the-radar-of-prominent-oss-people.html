<p>“i&#39;m really interested in getting involved in open source. I&#39;ve tried working on projects before but sometimes I felt that they were so complex that either a) i didn&#39;t know where to begin or b) i didn&#39;t have the knowledge to make worthwhile contributions”</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Make a list of what languages and you want to work in for the future. I loved javascript and node, so we’ll go with that. I like js and node as choices for myself because javascript will NEVER go away. And tons of companies use it. And almost every company uses it for their web build process. And almost company needs a front-end and/or performant back-end. You can even do robots with javascript. And you can obviously do graphics with webgl. A few brown alums have even written a webgl version of photoshop. </li>
<li>First let’s tune into the community<ul>
<li>Make a github account, make a twitter account</li>
<li>Go to <a href="https://github.com/nodejs/node">https://github.com/nodejs/node</a></li>
<li>Follow the top 50 contributors, by clicking graphs &gt; contributors</li>
<li>Open each person’s github profile, and google them to follow them on twitter</li>
<li>Over time, unfollow the people who aren’t tweeting about javascript enough</li>
<li>Over time, reply to people’s tweets, star them, etc. Be nice and a person.</li>
<li>Set a recognizable profile photo on twitter and on Github.</li>
<li>Over time they will remember you. They will also see you interacting on the github repo. They will think of you. When you are looking for internships, you can @mention the ones you might want to work with. Or you can email them. Or you can do both! Remember: they only hire interns because interns make them more money than they pay them. Otherwise they wouldn’t hire you. You are doing THEM a favor by working for them. This also means you should not feel bad about emailing them multiple times. They will look good if you get hired, because they sent you.</li>
<li>These people will be the ones who may hire you without a resume (if you ever get lazy and don’t want to update one). They already know you can code because they can see your github repos. They know you are a nice person.</li>
<li>Go to any events you can that they are attending. DON’T PAY MONEY TO GO TO ANYTHING. Email or tweet at the organizers and ask to volunteer. Tell them you are a CS student and want to help with the event.</li>
<li>“Where can I find info about these events that these people are attending?”</li>
<li>You will find info about events because these top node contributors will tweet about which ones they are going to. You can also find events on sites like <a href="http://meetup.com">http://meetup.com</a>, <a href="http://lanyrd.com/">http://lanyrd.com/</a>, <a href="http://nodeschool.io/">http://nodeschool.io/</a></li>
<li>If no one is tweeting aobut events, you can @mention them and ask what upcoming conferences they are going to, because you want to attend. You can also google “node conference” and “javascript conference” and then email the organizers and ask to volunteer at the upcoming ones.</li>
<li>Bonus section</li>
<li>Also, sign up for javascript weekly and node weekly and react weekly and every other weekly email newsletter that you care about. This will tell you about good articles, good tutorials, good events, etc.</li>
<li>Join IRC (e.g. <a href="http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=node.js&amp;uio=d4">http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=node.js&amp;uio=d4</a>), and relevant Slack channels <a href="http://www.slacklist.info/">http://www.slacklist.info/</a> <a href="https://hamsterpad.com/">https://hamsterpad.com/</a>. Start chatting with maintainers, and other engineers. When you ask for help make sure to show that you’ve done your research. E.g. “I already googled this a ton and tried three tutorials, but couldn’t figure it out. Can anyone help me with x?” You can also ask for links if you don’t know how to google it correctly (not sure the right words to use, etc). IRC and slack channels are where all the cool/impressive/famous engineers are hanging out and chatting, and you can get access to them, you just have to know about it (and now you do!). Please tweet <a href="https://twitter.com/ddtrejo">@ddtrejo</a> and thank me :) Or email david [att] dtrejo dot com.</li>
