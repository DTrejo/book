I know of 1-2 classmates who were injured as a result of CS169. I managed to hurt my hands in a different way during senior year: I worked hard all week, then on Saturday I played 7 hours of Halo 4. Then on Sunday, I thought &quot;wow I wasted all of Saturday, I need to work hard!&quot; so I programmed on an uncomfortable round table in my dining room for 6 hours. That evening, my forearms were on fire. When I woke up they were still in pain. I knew I had a problem. I told my professors what had happened, they understood, and I did the rest of my classwork with pen and paper (and didn&#39;t really have to do my programming assignments).</p>
<h2>Hand Pain Does Not Go Away</h2><p>Hand pain does not go away like other injuries. You could take a 6 month break from all computer and phone use, and you still wouldn&#39;t feel much better. There are really only two main ways to improve: 1) go to India and get excruciating massage on your trigger points for 6 months in a row 2) go to an acupuncturist who actually knows what they are doing. I&#39;m better now, but only because I&#39;ve done a lot of acupuncture, and am careful with myself.</p>
<p>At the end of this chapter I&#39;ve included a bunch of links from when I first had pain and did a ton of research to figure it out. I also invited Guilliame Marceu, a Brown alum, to speak to the CS department on how to avoid and fix oneself. He had it way worse and was able to partially recover. Imagine not being able to wash dishes, wash your hair, or have sex, because you can barely use your hands. And of course not type. It&#39;s terrible, and you should watch out.</p>
<h2>How likely is it that you&#39;ll get it?</h2><p>From my class, 2013, and one above, 2012, I can think of six people who need to use kinesis keyboards, one person who couldn&#39;t work for a week, and another person who couldn&#39;t work at all, and had to go on long term disability. I personally have to be careful. They say that bigger hands make it less likely, but I have large hands and still got it (my pain stems from further up, where my arm meets my shoulder).</p>
<p>I&#39;m sure there are more Brown CS alums with pain than I know about. In 2013 and 2012 the classes were about 100 graduates each. So out of 200 people, based on the people I knew, 9 of 200 people have had hand problems. Now that classes are ~165 &hellip;</p><h2><a href="https://gumroad.com/l/CSGETMONEY">Want to unlock the rest of the chapter?</a></h2><p><a href="https://gumroad.com/l/CSGETMONEY">Get the book &rarr;<br><span class="chevron"><img src="images/cover-medium.jpeg" height="500" class="cover"></span></a></p></article></main><footer><p><strong>Not ready to buy the book?</strong> Get sent the <strong>full</strong> best chapter on salary negotiation.
