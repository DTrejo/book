<h2>Steven Shi, Brown CS &#39;?? Asks &quot;How Do I Pick Good Companies?&quot;</h2><blockquote>
<p>&quot;Hey David, saw your post in Brown CS.<br/>I want to ask about how you went from being an engineer purely to being an engineering consultant as well as your advice for selecting a job / career path (picking the right startup vs settling in a big company).</p>
<p>Seeing the data from Brown&#39;s graduate CS class, like 80% of the graduates go into an established company like Google, FB, Apple.  What can you say about joining a startup or other career paths to consider. thanks for your time.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To answer your question I need to cover selecting startup vs bigco, and how to choose the right startup, based on both facts (venture, team, sales, marketing, founder’s personal goals) and your informed gut, and my mistake in not listening to Shriram’s advice, even though I asked him for it. I personally think it is VERY good that most students go to bigcos. Bigcos help you pay back debt. They allow you to save money. They teach you real industry software engineering skills and give you big technical problems to work on that one may not see at a startup (where the big problems are making money, and making more money).</p>
<h2>Steven Also Asks… &quot;May I Also Ask Why You&#39;re Documenting These? Is It for an Article?&quot;</h2><p>I may become a mentor soon for Brown CS students, and I don&#39;t want to repeat myself! ideally I will eventually send the writing out to people in the department, but I need to edit it a bunch first (so please don’t share this!). With this, you know exactly what&#39;s up as soon as you finish reading it, ideally in the first semester of freshman year.</p>
<p>Hell, one could even read it prior to joining Brown. It would be a great tool for convincing students on the edge that they should choose Brown, because we know wtf we are doing and the return on investment is amazing. Also, it will convince parents that we have our shit together.</p>
<h2>“First Interview Went Well, What Now?”</h2><ul>
<li>Ask everything of them that you would ask a friend who works at the company.</li>
<li>E.g. what will we cover in round 2? How can I prepare?</li>
<li>etc</li>
<li>You have to ask for what you want, otherwise you won&#39;t get it. Relevant book I recommend you read; “How to ask for the moon and get it”. Probably only $4 used on amazon. Buy it! SUPER useful.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bessie Jiang &#39;15 asks…</h2><blockquote>
<p>&quot;I just finished my freshman year and did the CS17/18 intro track, so as of now I know some Racket, OCaml, Java and Scala. I&#39;d love to get your insight on other languages that are used often in the real world (e.g. I was thinking of learning Python or JS, and you mentioned Node.js; what are your opinions on node.js versus react.js?).&quot; </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Good question—node is for backend, and react is for frontend. if you are doing full stack javascript work you might use both. JS is very widely used, so you can&#39;t go wrong with learning it on the side, and hopefully getting to like it :)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;You mention creating an online presence by creating a personal website, and borrowing CSS from webtypography. What are your opinions on creating a website from scratch (and using that as an example of a personal project) versus making a site based on some pre-existing library? For example, right now, I just have a simple Bootstrap template website running until I get some time to build a more complex one. Do you think it&#39;s worth the time to create a from-scratch website, and what are employers&#39; opinions on websites built from templates?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Honestly, as long as you are communicating the key background information questions on your projects, all that matters is that your site is legible. It can&#39;t hurt to make it look better, but employers care about your business results, and your engineering skill, not your design skills.</p>
<h2>6 questions from Anthony Cruz</h2><blockquote>
<p>How important are the cs classes and non-cs classes I take? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>CS classes: important, depending on what part of industry you want to get a job in. Non-cs classes: not as important. Writing skill is what will make your life amazing in the future, definitely cultivate that, hopefully in ways that are fun for you and not grindy. e.g. consider doing 750words.com every day for a summer (I did this and loved it). Writing tips: <a href="http://dtrejo.com/how-to-write">http://dtrejo.com/how-to-write</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does it even matter which cs classes I take when applying for cs positions?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It somewhat does, to show you took challenging classes, and also if the engineering positions need certain expertise like machine learning, systems, networks, distributed systems, math, etc.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Will a low gpa due to non-cs classes negatively affect me as a university student/ new grad? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>No. You can list your CS GPA on your resume. employers don&#39;t care about non-CS classes. If your overall GPA is under 3.0, you can leave it off your resume (and recruiters will know it is below 3.0). If it is above 3.0, list it. Choose to share the GPA that is higher, your overall GPA vs your CS GPA.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When I apply for an internship am I better off picking between backend or front end, or saying that I am flexible with both and can do whichever the company thinks I&#39;m a better fit for (I am more of a flexible full stack engineer so I don&#39;t mind doing one or the other)? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hmm that&#39;s a tough one. Choose whichever problem feels it is calling to you more, whichever feels the most painful to your co-workers or users. This is an easy way to know that your work will be appreciated. Listen for the pain, ask questions about how they handle the problem today without help from software.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As an underrepresented minority (Latino) how will I feel about the culture? Will I be able to fit in at smaller companies that probably lack a lot of diversity? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am white-passing, so I think that it wasn&#39;t a big deal for me. I do have a Latino last name, I have no idea how that affected anything. Definitely follow my guidelines for picking companies and also consider not joining if you don&#39;t know anyone who you like at the company.</p>
<h2>Palak  asks</h2><blockquote>
<p>&quot;Are there some upper-level classes that are better to take earlier on because they would help me more in solving interview questions - or help me get an internship?&quot; </p>
</blockquote>
<p> You already have the basics for interviewing well. The big (three?) classes that will challenge you and get you recognized by brown grads: programming languages; networks; operating systems (maybe there are others or this has changed, I&#39;m not sure).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;How important is it to work on outside of class projects? and what makes a good side project? (Ex. using a certain stack) and maybe can you suggest some project ideas?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I recommend doing the OSS stuff I recommended. You can choose an OSS project that dovetails with your interests and that should make it fun to work on, and get you recognition. Don&#39;t choose a tiny project that no one uses. If you choose a medium size project, you can always move to a larger one later, if you&#39;re feeling it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;How do you find internships to apply to? I applied to a few things online last year and heard back from only one, so I figured that probably wasn&#39;t the way to go.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Are you applying the bonus section of <a href="http://dtrejo.com/how-to-email">http://dtrejo.com/how-to-email</a>? If not, that could be the issue. Also, you have an indian sounding name, so it is especially important to mention that you go to brown and can work in the US.</p>
<h2>Susan  on intervieing</h2><blockquote>
<p>&quot;Also wanted to ask, in regards to advice you had on interviewing for companies you didn&#39;t care about in fall, and ones you care about in spring, don&#39;t a ton of big companies finish recruiting in the fall? Was under this impression since the spring tech career fair always seemed smaller.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The fall career fair is bigger because full-time recruiting is bigger. So, if you&#39;re looking for full time work, you&#39;d start looking in september (or hell, if you&#39;re super ambitious, even during july/august while at your last internship as an about-to-be-senior). </p>
<p>The spring career fair is focused on interns, which is why it makes sense for freshman, sophomores, juniors to interview with companies they don&#39;t care about in first semester, because second semester they can get their internship. Of course, sooner is ALWAYS better, so if you feel ready, start sooner! Just make sure that when you mke the mental shift to looking at companies you actually do want to join, follow the job searching advice, so you dont waste time on companies you dont want to join (viciously stop talking to any company who doesnt fit your criteria).</p>
<h2>Rishabh  Advice on Design and Product Management?</h2><blockquote>
<p>&quot;I was wondering if you advise people regarding design and product management positions too?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you probably noticed, many of the same topics apply to design and product management, although i haven&#39;t given any specific advice. I recommend following the same overall strategies. <a href="http://jascha.io">http://jascha.io</a> is an example of a designer who speaks business. Mattias Wagner is a PM who I&#39;ve personally seen successfully run one of the most difficult projects I&#39;ve seen. You can see his writing at <a href="&amp;#109;&amp;#97;&amp;#x69;&amp;#x6c;&amp;#116;&amp;#x6f;&amp;#x3a;&amp;#x68;&amp;#116;&amp;#x74;&amp;#x70;&amp;#x73;&amp;#58;&amp;#47;&amp;#47;&amp;#x6d;&amp;#101;&amp;#x64;&amp;#105;&amp;#117;&amp;#109;&amp;#46;&amp;#x63;&amp;#111;&amp;#109;&amp;#x2f;&amp;#x40;&amp;#x6d;&amp;#x61;&amp;#x74;&amp;#116;&amp;#x68;&amp;#105;&amp;#x61;&amp;#115;&amp;#x77;&amp;#97;&amp;#x67;&amp;#110;&amp;#x65;&amp;#114;">&#x68;&#116;&#x74;&#x70;&#x73;&#58;&#47;&#47;&#x6d;&#101;&#x64;&#105;&#117;&#109;&#46;&#x63;&#111;&#109;&#x2f;&#x40;&#x6d;&#x61;&#x74;&#116;&#x68;&#105;&#x61;&#115;&#x77;&#97;&#x67;&#110;&#x65;&#114;</a> (I haven&#39;t read it, but I know he knows what he is doing). Here&#39;s a crazy thought: DON&#39;T READ ARTICLES ON HOW TO GET PM/DESIGN JOBS. Instead, read articles written by hiring managers, advising other managers on how to hire designers and pms. You&#39;ll get into the minds of hiring managers much more easily this way. Make sure the authors are actually good though… you don&#39;t want to learn how people are hired from people who are terrible bosses with blogs.</p>
<h2>Sophie Lee asks &quot;I started CS late, how do I get an industry internship after Junior year?&quot;</h2><blockquote>
<p>&quot;As I read through your book, I realized that many of the circumstances unfortunately do not apply to me. I first set out for a job in finance, then steered away from it and decided to pursue computer science beginning my sophomore year. I have not yet had a real industry job (at least in the tech industry), and all of the positions I have gotten/hope to get soon are within the Brown CS department only. </p>
<p>All of these circumstances make me somewhat uncertain about the prospects of securing an internship after my junior year. I was wondering if you could give me any advice on how people who come from more unique backgrounds (began cs late, not a cs major, etc.) can present themselves to employers/ boost confidence / navigate through the process / or anything really. &quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The resume advice and understanding your value sections of the book still apply. Keep attending resume review sessions, and consider ask the testimonial questions of your bosses at brown. The 6 questions to ask: <a href="http://www.brainaudit.com/cklists/BrainAuditTestimonials.pdf">http://www.brainaudit.com/cklists/BrainAuditTestimonials.pdf</a>. Then take the answers, smush them together in the exact same order and without changing anything (especially don&#39;t change the answer to the obstacle question), maybe do small typo/flow edits, then get yes/no approval (don&#39;t let them edit directly!) and put it on your website. Also ask &quot;why did you hire me?&quot; and then use all these answers to improve your resume and talk about what boss&#39;s care about.</p>
<h2>How to handle rejection?</h2><p>Rejection is your friend—get excited that 1) you got practice 2) you learned something about how to interview 3) you don&#39;t have to waste your valuable time following up with a company that doesn&#39;t want you anymore (and which would not enjoy working for if they didn&#39;t think you&#39;d be a good &quot;fit&quot;).</p>
<h2>Ali also asks</h2><blockquote>
<p>&quot;Hey david, i have a quick question. I always hear about people getting interviews for internships at hackathons and recruiter events. When i&#39;m at these events, i feel so awkward to just throw my resume at these recruiters. how do you go about trying to get a job here without being rude?</p>
<p>this might be a dumb question ahah&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No dumb questions dude, don&#39;t ever think that. There is only a question that one did not research enough fully prior to asking :) this one is a good one. Shriram said something wise about asking questions once, but I don&#39;t remember it. You should ask him what he said :)</p>
<p>You: &quot;What made you want to come to this hackathon?&quot;</p>
<p>Them: &quot;just for fun&quot; / &quot;I&#39;m here to see what projects people are working on&quot; / &quot;I&#39;m here hiring&quot;</p>
<p>You: &quot;Oh cool, are you here because you&#39;re hiring?&quot; / &quot;Well I hope my project impresses you enough that you want to hire me on the spot! But I&#39;ll settle for being asked for my resume :)&quot; / &quot;Oh, cool, who are you looking for?&quot;</p>
<p>Them: [conversation continues and it is clear you want to talk to them about the internship]</p>
<p>Good luck! People always want to be asked about what they are working on (&quot;What are you working on?&quot;) and they are here because they want to hire, or promote their company for later, for when you are looking for full-time work. You must ask to recieve, read &quot;how to ask for the moon and get it&quot; to learn just that.</p>
<h3>&quot;How to Avoid Interview Scheduling Hell?&quot;</h3><p>Answer: get yourself a <a href="http://calendly.com">http://calendly.com</a> and have recruiters pick from it.</p>
<h2>Which language to use while interviewing?</h2><blockquote>
<p>&quot;So I&#39;m proficient in python and Java, not sure which to use for SE interviews. Python is easier but Java has more data structures.&quot; – Abhishek Sharma, Brown Math Major</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Use python because it is easier to write without typos and higher level. This assumes you&#39;re equally confident with it. You don&#39;t want syntax to distract you from the problem you&#39;re solving.</p>
<h2>Am I behind because I didn&#39;t take CS19?</h2><blockquote>
<p>I have been skimming this, and one thing that I would change so far is: &quot;Pay attention in CS19 and the other intro CS classes.&quot; Pretty subtle, but I think that people in CS17/CS15 already feel self-conscious about the fact that CS19 is supposed to be for more advanced/quicker students. I would just say &quot;Pay attention in your intro CS classes.&quot; – Katelyn</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Katelyn, thank you for saying this! I actually felt that CS19 prepared me WORSE, because I didn&#39;t get as thorough practice for interviews.
