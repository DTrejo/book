<li>Buy or “borrow” “Cracking the Coding Interview”. Do the whole fucking book. Yes I am going to curse in this guide.</li>
<li>“But I have lots of OSS, companies should hire me without a resume!!!!”</li>
<li>That may be true. And you may be able to get jobs anyway. However, you will always feel like you aren’t good at technical interviews. This will also hinder your ability to get offers from Google, which you can use to negotiate up your offers at EVERY other company, and also it will drive recruiters into a frenzy. They will suddenly reply to your emails and fast-track you and all kinds of other things. Hell, ask them to express you an aeron chair to show they are serious about hiring you and see what happens (do this if you are feeling adventurous and with a company you don’t care about—I haven’t tried this but it might work). Aerons are worth $1000, and they could reasonably spend that much flying you out and interviewing you, so it’s not unreasonable to ask for, especially if other companies have already flown you to san francisco and they are benefitting from being able to interview you while you are in town. </li>
<li>“But I don’t want to do the book” i am already good enough at technical interviewing.</li>
<li>This is just like taking the SAT. You study as much as you can for it. You want to feel as comfortable as possible in your interviews. You will already be meeting 5+ new people in one day, and talking about yourself the whole time. You need as much comfort in the actual interview as possible to get through it. Remember also how much of the SAT was knowing certain tricks? Same thing here.</li>
<li>“But I don’t want to get many job offers”</li>
<li>Yes, you do want many offers.</li>
<li>Pay attention in CS19 and the other intro CS classes. Especially the ones where you learn about time &hellip;</li></ul><h2><a href="https://gumroad.com/l/CSGETMONEY">Want to unlock the rest of the chapter?</a></h2><p><a href="https://gumroad.com/l/CSGETMONEY">Get the book &rarr;<br><span class="chevron"><img src="images/cover-medium.jpeg" height="500" class="cover"></span></a></p></article></main><footer><p><strong>Not ready to buy the book?</strong> Get sent the <strong>full</strong> best chapter on salary negotiation.
